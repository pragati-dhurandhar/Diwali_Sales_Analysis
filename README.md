# Python: Diwali Sales Analysis

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project involves an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a Diwali sales dataset. The primary goal is to clean and analyze the data to understand customer purchasing patterns and identify key sales drivers. By exploring demographics (like age, gender, marital status, and state) and product-level trends, the analysis aims to uncover actionable insights for business growth.

## ❓ Key Questions & Objectives

This analysis seeks to answer several business-critical questions:

  * Which customer demographics (gender, age group, marital status) contribute most to sales revenue?
  * Which states are the top-performing in terms of orders and total sales amount?
  * What are the most popular product categories, and which specific products drive the most sales?
  * What is the relationship between customer age and their purchasing power?
  * What are the key conclusions and actionable insights that can be shared with the sales and marketing teams?

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

  * **Python**
  * **Pandas** (for data manipulation and analysis)
  * **NumPy** (for numerical operations)
  * **Matplotlib** (for static visualizations)
  * **Seaborn** (for enhanced statistical visualizations)
  * **Jupyter Notebook** (as the analysis environment)

## 📊 Analysis & Process

1.  **Data Cleaning:**
      * Inspected the dataset for missing values, duplicates, and incorrect data types.
      * Handled null values (e.g., dropped rows/columns or imputed values).
      * Standardized column names and corrected data types (e.g., converting sales figures to numeric).
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
      * Performed statistical analysis to understand sales distribution.
      * Analyzed sales performance based on customer gender, age, marital status, and location (state).
      * Investigated product-level trends, identifying top-selling categories and products.
3.  **Visualization & Insights:**
      * Created various plots (bar charts, count plots, pie charts) to visualize findings.
      * Synthesized the analysis to identify high-value customer segments and popular product categories.
      * Drew final conclusions to provide data-driven recommendations for the business.
